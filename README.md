Keypirinha Time
=======================

This is a package that extends the fast keystroke launcher keypirinha (http://keypirinha.com/) with
a command to convert and format datetime strings.

## Usage

Use the `Time:` item. (configurable)
If no other input is entered the displayed datetime is the current time.
Any input is interpreted as date string (or at least tried to)

Executing any of the suggestions copies the selected item to the clipboard.

## Configuration

It's possible to configure multiple formats and locales in which the time is displayed. See the
default configuration file for further information.
